It is always easier to judge the quality of a survey if you are able to try it out yourself. This is why we have decided to make our survey available. We have disabled all checks for answers and are displaying the answers you provide in real time. As such, it also functions as a "code book" in that you can see exactly how the data was recorded in the database. 

To test it, just head over [here](https://survey.inspire-project.info)

We have made the [source code](https://github.com/edsandorf/inspire-project-survey) available through Erlend's GitHub repository and hope that this can serve as inspiration for others who seek to implement a survey using Shiny. If anyone wants to have a chat about lessons learned, please feel free to contact us. Or if you want us to write a post about it, we are more than happy to!
