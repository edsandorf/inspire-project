I gave a presentation titled "An information search approach to discrete choice experiments" at the EAERE conference in Berlin. Well, the conference was not in Berlin this year, but was hosted online because of COVID-19. The title of the presentation is the same as the one presented at [ICMC](https://edsandorf.me/posts/news/2019/2019-08-icmc/) in August last year, but new in this presentation is that we have the acual data, which was [gathered in January](https://inspire-project.info/news/2020/01/31/data-gathering-complete.html).
