excerpt: Can we use a Shiny application to show reviewers interactive choice tasks?
---
  
As a reviewer it is often difficult to assess the quality of a survey and know exactly what information respondents were provided with. We know that people's information sets affect their stated preferences and that framing and anchoring can have significant impact on elicited values. Therefore, it is crucial to know what respondents knew to meaningfully interpret results. Given that our survey was programmed in Shiny (see our previous post on the topic), creating an application with only the choice tasks and information videos was relatively straight forward. In the application, you can easily switch between all 10 survey treatments and see the information videos showed to respondents as well as test the exact choice task that respondents answered. Prior to publishing this post, we have shown the choice task tool to colleagues and received good feedback on it.

To test the choice task tool just head over [here](https://choice-tasks.inspire-project.info) and if you want to have a look at the source code, just visit the [GitHub](https://github.com/edsandorf/inspire-project-choice-tasks) repository.
